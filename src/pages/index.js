    <h1>Hi people</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Thilina and I'm from Brampton, Canada. I just graduated from the University with a Biomedical Science degree. However, my love for computer science didn't fade since high school and I want to find that passion I had for it again. I've been working on freecodecamp on and off, but this hackathon will be enough motivation to complete the 2 courses. I'm excited to meet so many people and get a richer look into the fields of Computer Science. Much love!</p>
